# AI for PowerVM based IBM Power systems
This repo will contain example code to run Tensorflow and scikit-learn models in PowerVM based IBM Power systems.

This project demonstrates:

 - how you can install the Watson Machine Learning Community Edition (WML CE) on Little-endian Linux LPAR in a PowerVM based IBM Power system.
 - how to do non-accelarated inferencing on data(residing in DB2 database) in a AIX LPAR by using model deployed on Linux LPAR. 
 - Run examples using Tensorflow and scikit-learn

The models are trained and deployed using Watson Machine Learning - Community Edition (WMLCE) on Linux LPAR.
The deployed models on Linux LPAR can be called from AIX using REST APIs for inferencing on AIX data.
The data on AIX can be residing in DB2/Oracle database.
AIX and Linux systems are LPARs in a PowerVM based IBM Power system.
